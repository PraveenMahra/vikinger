              You can also create public and private groups in order to find
              people that share your same interests! We also created an account

              we built a super complete gamification system that has badges,
              quests, ranks and credits. To link all to the overall design, we
              created widgets for the profiles, credits counters for the top

              <br />

              Inside the Illustrations folder, you’ll find PSD files with lots

              choosing the ones you like the most! Also, they are all made with
